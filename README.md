# AdvancedLaneFinding

This repository contains my implementation on the computer vision project of Lane Finding for  self driving cars. 

One reason driving safe is possible is because lanes can be defined. These lanes define regions that cars can ride on, allowing for two-way and one-way drives on roads. 

An important part of building Self Driving Cars, is detecting the lanes on roads
